This repository contains the code for the project in Machine learning programming course, the project tasks are to reproduce the experiment and the result a research paper available in google scholar. As a team we selected the following paper:
L. Yang, A. Moubayed, I. Hamieh and A. Shami, "Tree-Based Intelligent Intrusion Detection System in Internet of Vehicles," in 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2019, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013892

The paper in general developed different machine learning algorithms on the CICIDS2017 dataset, a popular network traffic dataset for intrusion detection problems.
Dataset available at: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html
The code and proposed framework in the paper was added to a public GitHub reposetary available at: https://github.com/Western-OC2-Lab/Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning/tree/main
